The web interface, client, and the server are implemented separately.
The application was tested where the client was run on Apache/2.2.15 (Unix)
and the server on apache-tomcat-8.0.33.

The server side is implemented in java using Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate
and the H2 in-memory database. The database and ORM are used to demonstrate
caching.

The IDE is 'Spring Tool Suite'.

The client side is implemented in ReactJS.

Dollar values are entered and the 'Get Change' but is clicked to request 
an object from the server containing coin counts corresponding to the
dollar amount. The counts are displayed in a table with no duplicates.
